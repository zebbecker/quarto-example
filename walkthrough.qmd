## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

-   It's *plain text* so works well with version control
-   It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
-   Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>
-   You can edit code visually, too!

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import os
os.cpu_count()
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
