## Our Work 

Short, 1 paragraph summary of team's work, vision. 

## Resources
Our team and collaborators develop and maintain the Fire Event Data Suite, or FEDS. The FEDS code is open source and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Earth-Information-System/fireatlas). 

With FEDS, we continously generate subdaily estimated fire perimeters using data from the VIIRS sensors on Suomi-NPP and NOAA20 satellites. We currently make data available for several regions of interest, including the continental United States, on our public [API](mapping-fires.ipynb).

Researchers interested in exploring our data can read more about our [data products](data.qmd) and [recent publications](publications.qmd), and are welcome to contact us for further discussion. 

Developers should consult our [technical documentation](system_architecture.qmd) and engage with our community on GitHub.
